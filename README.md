This repository serves as a place to showcase various machine learning algorithms implemented in different programming languages. Machine learning algorithms can be divided into two major groups: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Within these two groups, algorithms can be further divided into classification and prediction algorithms. The algorithms shown here include: 

- Supervised Learning
  - Perceptron (classification)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (classification)
  - Linear Regression (prediction)
  - Logistic Regression (classification)
  - Deep Learning (classification)
  - Decision Trees (prediction)
  - Regression Trees (prediction)
- Unsupervised Learning
  - K-Means Clustering (classification)
