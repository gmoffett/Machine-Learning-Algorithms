This repository serves as a place to showcase various machine learning algorithms implemented in different programming languages. Machine learning algorithms can be divided into two major groups: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. The algorithms shown here include: 
- Perceptron (Supervised)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (Supervised)
